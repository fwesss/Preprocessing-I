            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a 32 year old business person with a passion for work.
                Nothing is as fulfilling as work. It doesn't even matter
                what I'm actually doing at work. 5am - 9pm everyday, I will not
                leave my chair
                until the job is done.
            </p>

            <p>
                Outside of work, there is just waiting for more work because I
                can't get enough. If I could forgo sleep to provide even
                more productivity, I would do so happily. There is no way there
                is a better employee than me and I am a must have for your
                company. Please hire me for money.
            </p>

            <h2>Experience</h2>

            <h3>Metacortex</h3>
            <p class="title">Central Functionality Producer</p>
            <p class="timespan">February 2017 - Present</p>
            <p>
                Currently, I produce all of the central functionality of our
                great product. The rest of our 1,500 employee company works on
                secondary functionality because they only slow me down. Without
                my abilities, this company would cease to work. I am the
                linchpin, cornerstone, greatest asset, and pillar of this
                corporation.
            </p>

            <h3>Vandelay Industries</h3>
            <p class="title">Principal Implementation Specialist</p>
            <p class="timespan">March 2016 - April 2016</p>
            <p>
                It only took me one month to make all positions at Vandelay
                Industries redundant. This includes my own. The company is now
                defunct.
            </p>

            <h3>Nakatomi Corporation</h3>
            <p class="title">Investor Resonance Facilitator</p>
            <p class="timespan">January 2015 - March 2016</p>
            <p>
                Prior to joining Nakatomi, our board room was chaotic and in
                constant disarray. By amplifying proprietary frequencies
                through the video conference feed, I was able to soothe the
                minds of our investors and bring about harmony in our board
                meetings. Synergy increased by 312.73% and the company was
                transformed.
